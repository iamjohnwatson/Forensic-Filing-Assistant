## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. Advanced Filing Downloader
Search and retrieve filings for any US public company or private fund.
*   **Comprehensive Search:** Supports standard Tickers (AAPL, NVDA) and **names** (e.g., "Public Investment Fund", "Bridgewater") via a robust 37MB fallback index.
*   **Expanded Filing Support:** 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, 20-F, 6-K, S-1, S-1/A, DEF 14A, PRE 14A, NT 10-K, NT 10-Q.
*   **Intelligent Filtering:** Smart logic ensures searching for "10-K" doesn't accidentally return "NT 10-K" (late notices).
*   **Reader Mode:** Click the "Read" button to view any filing in a clean, distraction-free, serif-font layout optimized for reading and printing to PDF.
*   **Enhanced Batch Download:** "Download All" zips up to 20 filings as **Enhanced HTML** files that render perfectly offline with injected CSS and absolute image paths.

### 2. Whale Tracker 🐳
Analyze institutional 13-F filings to see what the "smart money" is doing.
*   **Holdings Analysis:** Automatically parses 13F-HR XML data to display current holdings.
*   **Change Detection:** Compares the current quarter vs. previous quarter to highlight **Top Buys** and **Top Sells**.
*   **Visual Design:** Minimalist, editorial design with a dark mode that feels professional and data-rich.

### 3. Sophisticated UI/UX
*   **Design System:** Built with a "minimalist/editorial" aesthetic.
*   **Dark Mode:** Fully integrated toggle (☀️/🌙) with smooth transitions.
*   **Responsive:** Works seamlessly on desktop and tablet.

## ⚠️ Deployment Note

This application relies on **Server-Side API Routes** to proxy requests to the SEC (to handle User-Agent headers and CORS).

*   **Do NOT deploy to GitHub Pages** (Static hosting will break the API).
*   **Recommended:** Deploy to **Vercel** or any Node.js hosting.

### Deploying to Vercel
1.  Push your code to GitHub.
2.  Import the repo on [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com).
3.  Deploy (Zero configuration required).
